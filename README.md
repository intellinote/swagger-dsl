# swagger-dsl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intellinote/swagger-dsl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intellinote/swagger-dsl) [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/intellinote/swagger-dsl.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/swagger-dsl) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/swagger-dsl.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/swagger-dsl)

A CoffeeScript-based domain-specific language for generating JSON documents for Swagger.

## Try it Now

See <http://intellinote.github.io/swagger-dsl/demo/live.html> for an in-browser, interactive demonstration.

## Example

Here is a Swagger-DSL-format document describing a simple REST API:

```coffeescript
swagger_version 1.2
api_version 3.2
base_path 'http://api.example.com/rest/v3.2/'

GET '/user/{uid}':
  summary: 'Fetch the user with the specified `uid`.'
  returns: 'UserModel'
  produces: json
  parameters:
    uid:[path,int64,required,'The user identifier']
    include:[query,string,default:'family_name,given_name,email']
  responses:
    200:true
    401:'User or application must authenticate'
    403:'User not authorized to take this action'
    404:'No user with the given `uid`'

MODEL 'UserModel':
  uid:         ['User identifier',int64,required]
  given_name:  ['First name',string]
  family_name: ['Last name',string]
  email:       ['Email address',required,string]
  tel:         ['Phone numbers',[ref:'PhoneNumber']]

MODEL 'PhoneNumber':
  type: [string,enum:['home','work','mobile','other'],required]
  number: [string,required]
```

When processed with `swagger-dsl` (for example, by executing `swagger-dsl listings/user`), the following [Swagger Specification](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) JSON document is generated:

```json
{
  "apis": [
    {
      "path": "/user/{uid}",
      "operations": [

## Installing

### Via npm

Swagger DSL is published as [`swagger-dsl` on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/swagger-dsl).

Hence you can install a pre-packaged version with the command:

```bash
npm install -g swagger-dsl
```

(Omit the `-g` to install swagger-dsl "locally" in the current working directory.)

### From Source

The source code and documentation for Swagger DSL is available on GitHub at [intellinote/swagger-dsl](https://github.com/intellinote/swagger-dsl).  You can clone the repository via:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:intellinote/swagger-dsl
```

Once you've cloned the respository, move (`cd`) into it and run:

```bash
make clean install test bin
```

in order to download and compile any external depedencies (`install`), run the unit test suite to confirm that everything was installed properly (`test`) and create the `swagger-dsl` script in the `./bin` directory (`bin`).

## Using

### Basics

Assuming `swagger-dsl` is in your `$PATH` (it will be in `node_modules/.bin` if you installed via npm, or `./bin` if you installed from the source files) you can run:

```bash
swagger-dsl myfile.dsl
```

to generate a [Swagger Specification](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) JSON document from the Swagger DSL file `myfile.dsl`.

By default Swagger DSL will parse and execute each file you enumerate on the command line and print the resulting JSON document(s) to STDOUT.

You can use:

```bash
swagger-dsl myfile.dsl -o myfile.json
```

to write the output to the specified file.

### Renaming output files with `-x`

You can also use:

```bash
swagger-dsl myfile.dsl -x "json"
```

to write the output to a file named `myfile.dsl.json`.  (More generally, `-x` or `--suffix` specifies an extension to add to the input file name(s) to generate output file name(s).  Hence:

```bash
swagger-dsl listings/*.dsl -x "json"
```

will process all files with the extension `.dsl` in the `listings` directory. The output from processing each file will be written to files with names that end with `.dsl.json`, also in the `listings` directory.)

### Renaming output files with `-r`

For greater control over the generated filenames you can use the `-r` or `--rename` command line option to specify a rule for generating output file names based on input file names.  For example:

```bash
swagger-dsl listings/*.dsl --rename '/^(.+)\.dsl$/,\"$1\"'
```

will change the extension from `.dsl` to `.json`.

More generally, `-r` or `--rename` accepts a comma-delimited regular expression, string pair.  The regular expression will be matched against the input filename, and the string will be used to generate the output filename (by replacing `$n` with the text matching *n*th group in the regular expression).

## How to contribute

Your contributions, [bug reports](https://github.com/intellinote/swagger-dsl/issues) and [pull-requests](https://github.com/intellinote/swagger-dsl/pulls) are greatly appreciated.

We're happy to accept any help you can offer, but the following
guidelines can help streamline the process for everyone.

 * You can report any bugs at
   [github.com/intellinote/swagger-dsl/issues](https://github.com/intellinote/swagger-dsl/issues).

    - We'll be able to address the issue more easily if you can
      provide an demonstration of the problem you are
      encountering. The best format for this demonstration is a
      failing unit test (like those found in
      [./test/](https://github.com/intellinote/swagger-dsl/tree/master/test)), but
      your report is welcome with or without that.

 * Our preferred channel for contributions or changes to the
   source code and documentation is as a Git "patch" or "pull-request".

    - If you've never submitted a pull-request, here's one way to go
      about it:

        1. Fork or clone the repository.
        2. Create a local branch to contain your changes (`git
           checkout -b my-new-branch`).
        3. Make your changes and commit them to your local repository.
        4. Create a pull request [as described here](
           https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

    - If you'd rather use a private (or just non-GitHub) repository,
      you might find
      [these generic instructions on creating a "patch" with Git](https://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/)
      helpful.

 * If you are making changes to the code please ensure that the
   [unit test suite](./test) still passes.

 * If you are making changes to the code to address a bug or introduce
   new features, we'd *greatly* appreciate it if you can provide one
   or more [unit tests](./test) that demonstrate the bug or
   exercise the new feature.

**Please Note:** We'd rather have a contribution that doesn't follow
these guidelines than no contribution at all.  If you are confused
or put-off by any of the above, your contribution is still welcome.
Feel free to contribute or comment in whatever channel works for you.
